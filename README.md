# webex-elgato

Use this Python script with WebEx to automatically turn on your Elgato Key Light when in a meeting, and off when you're not.

This script uses WebEx API so this works with any device - phone, computer
or even WebEx DeskPro. 

You can also use this as an "On Air" / "Do not disturb" light to let visitors know that
you are currently in a meeting.

## How to use

Rename `constants.py.example` to `constants.py` and edit with your own credentials from
WebEx.

Execute the script:

`python3 ./elgato-webex-auto.py`

Done!
